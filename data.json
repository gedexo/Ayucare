Numbness can ensue along a single nerve on one side of the body or evenly on both sides of the body. It can also cause sensations like burning or pins and needles feeling. When a lesion on the spinal cord creates minor trouble with the neuro system it may result in sensory loss. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight and hearing.

Whatever your bowel movement pattern is, it’s unique and normal for you as long as you don’t stray too far from your pattern. Piles or Haemorrhoids are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. Haemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum (internal haemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external haemorrhoids). Haemorrhoids have a number of causes, but often the cause is unknown.

Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviours. Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function. Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep or cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake up. How much sleep is enough varies from person to person, but most adults need seven to eight hours a night. At some point, many adults experience short-term (acute) insomnia, which lasts for days or weeks. It's usually the result of stress or a traumatic event. But some people have long-term (chronic) insomnia that lasts for a month or more."

            "description": "The major medical conditions that are of significant concern to women are heart diseases, breast cancer, osteoporosis, depression and autoimmune diseases. A hormone is a chemical substance produced by glands in the endocrine system and release into the bloodstream for performing or assisting specific functionalities. The hormone imbalance occurs when there is too much production of hormones or too little production of hormone takes place. Hormonal imbalance may cause a range of unwanted symptoms from fatigue or weight gain to itchy skin or low mood. The most typical female hormone disorder is Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It leads to irregular periods, ovarian cysts, weight gain and fertility problems. Uterine fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis and primary ovarian insufficiency can lead to infertility. The disorders that affect only women include turner syndrome, Rett syndrome and ovarian & cervical cancer."

            "description": "Low sperm count or oligospermia is a medical abnormality in which the fluid (semen) you ejaculate during an orgasm contains fewer sperm than normal. A complete absence of sperm is called azoospermia. Your sperm count is considered lower than normal if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per millilitre of semen. Having a low sperm count decreases the chances of making a partner pregnant. Anyway, many men who have a low sperm count are still able to father a child. The main sign of low sperm count is the inability to conceive a child. There might be no other obvious signs or symptoms. The other symptoms include problems with sexual function such as low sex drive or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction), pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area and decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosome or hormone abnormality. The production of sperm is a complex process and requires normal functioning of the testicles (testes) as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. There are several causes that develop this situation including medical causes, environmental causes and health, lifestyle and other causes."
